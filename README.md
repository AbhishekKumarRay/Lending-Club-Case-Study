## Lending club case study 
### Description of project
> Lending a loan is "risky" decision that a company takes .To avoid financial loss a company must choose to finance people cautiously.
 - The study identifies the risky loan applicants who might end up being a "defaulter" and can significantly bring financial loss to the lending company.
 - A rigourous analysis is done to identify those driving factors which helps us narrow down to pinpoint who might end up being a defaulter.

## General Information
- The borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders, reduces lenderâ€™s cash flow. Identifying those risky applicants helps in cutting down the amount of credit loss to the organization. The data set used is 'loan.csv'.


## Conclusions
Borrowers who have been employed for more than 10 years are at a higher likelihood of experiencing charge-offs.
Borrowers residing in mortgaged homes with loan amounts exceeding 12,000 are prone to charge-offs.
Loans designated for debt consolidation, credit card refinancing, or small business ventures, with an average loan amount surpassing 12,000, exhibit a higher likelihood of default.
Loans carrying the highest interest rates within their respective categories are more prone to charge-offs.
Loans designated for housing, debt consolidation, and small business, featuring the highest interest rates, are more likely to result in charge-offs.
Longer loan tenures tend to have higher interest rates, and individuals with terms between 15-20% are more susceptible to charge-offs.
Shorter loan tenures tend to have lower interest rates, and individuals with terms between 10-15% are more prone to charge-offs.
Borrowers falling under grade E, F, or G, with an average loan amount exceeding 15,000, are at an increased risk of charge-offs.
Borrowers with a verification status of "not-verified," holding loan amounts between 5,000 and 12,500, are more likely to experience charge-offs.
Borrowers with "not-verified" and "verified" verification statuses exhibit an equal proportion in charge-off occurrences.
An increase in the number of installments corresponds to a higher likelihood of charge-offs for borrowers with elevated interest rates.
